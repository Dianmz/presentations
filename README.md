# CNCF Community Presentations

### Incoming Changes (Pardon our dust)

This repository is becoming a backend for what will eventually become presentations.cncf.io.

- Frontend issues should be filed here: https://github.com/cncf/presentations-website/issues
- Existing data and presentations will not be removed and will be migrated eventually by @castrojo

Thanks for your patience!

### Submission Process
This is a work in progress and subject to change. Feel free to submit Pull Request (PR) for ideas and changes you'd like to see.

> What kind of talks are accepted vs. not accepted?

We are currently focusing on talks presented at CNCF Events about CNCF Projects, as these have already been vetted and accepted by the community. We aim to avoid editorializing in this repository. If your talk has been presented at a CNCF event, feel free to submit it. Check the [CNCF Projects page](cncf.io/projects/) for more information. 

> Do the talks have to be focused solely on cloud native projects, or can they cover other open source topics?

While our initial focus is on capturing talks related to CNCF projects, we hope to expand the scope to include a broader range of topics in the future. If you believe your talk is valuable, go ahead and submit it!

> Is there a limit on the number of talks one can submit?

Our goal is to collect as many CNCF-related talks as possible. Therefore, the only limit is the number of talks you can realistically present. :D 

> Can I submit talks on someone else's behalf?

Most of the information related to these talks is publicly available and published on schedules. If you wish to help your friends and colleagues submit their talks to enrich specific topic tags, you're encouraged to do so. However, please consult with the presenter before submitting a PR as a common courtesy.
