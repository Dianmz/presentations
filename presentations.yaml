- name: Leverage user traffic to automate load testing this holiday season # Required
  description: | # Optional
    Testing tools can’t keep pace with the complexity and speed of development. By the time you’ve manually scripted a test, it’s basically out of date. And how accurate is the data used in your mocks and tests anyway? With the holiday season bearing down on retailers, dev teams must be prepared for the onslaught of online sales and unpredictable user behavior that could throw a wrench in the system. Join Jeff Kwan, Principle Engineer at Cimpress, and Speedscale co-founder Nate Lee, for a conversation with CNCF’s Taylor Dolezal to learn the biggest obstacles in automating and accelerating load testing today and how existing user traffic holds the key to scaling ecommerce software safely—with speed.
